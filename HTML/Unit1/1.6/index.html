  <h1 class="Title">Project Showcase</h1>
  <h4 class="Main_Description">Here you can find all of my projects done in class</h4>
  <p class="Secondary_Description">This project aims to showcase all of the projects we worked on throughout the year.
    In each project we were intorduced into a new tag or group of tags. This project introduces us to the iframe tag
    which is how you can see these other webpages within this one. I have been using the <a href="https://replit.com"
      class="Replit_Link" target="_Blank">replit</a>
    editor to make all of these projects. The list below links every project's website in order, and will be updated
    when new projects are made. The projects shown here have been modified after their submission, with new tags and
    code. The original basic submission does not exist.</p>
