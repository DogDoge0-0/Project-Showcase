  <p class="text-j">Well, you've found my secret page. I suppose I might as well tell you what this page is all about. This page's purpose is to tell you about 0.1.0. 0.1.0 is a planed update to revamp the way that this entire site looks and feels. Responisve, clean buttons, proper image integration, proper mobile support, major bug fixes and perhaps a little more. You will just have to wait and see. 0.1.0 is planed to come out in Q1 (quarter 1) of 2023.</p>
